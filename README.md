# Welcome to Flow

### Purpose

This App was created as my final project in Web Development at Eleven Fifty Academy in May 2021.

It is based on a project I art directed three years ago for the Yoga Essence Project which was photographed in Indianapolis and produced a coffee table photo book of yoga poses, a poster and yoga sequencing cards. This app attempts to emulate the yoga sequencing cards. This app is ideal for a yoga enthusiast who either would like to create their own yoga session or for a yoga teacher to create a class.
